            <p>I am a dedicated third-year B. Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering, maintaining a CGPA of 9.1. My skill set encompasses a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flutter. With a strong focus on front-end development, I take pride in crafting visually appealing and responsive user interfaces that enhance user experience. In addition to my front-end expertise, I am continuously expanding my knowledge in full-stack development, allowing me to understand both client-side and server-side technologies. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced environments where I can apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges. <br> <br>
                
            I am particularly interested in leveraging emerging technologies, such as blockchain and machine learning, to create innovative solutions that drive efficiency and improve lives. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams to exchange ideas and foster creativity, believing that collaboration leads to better solutions. Outside of academics, I actively engage in personal projects and contribute to open-source initiatives, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I am excited about the future of technology and am eager to be part of a team that shapes its direction.</p>
